ShapeExample(Object Oriented Programing)
****************************************
There are four classes defined:

-> Program(Main Class)
-> CShape(Parent Class)
-> CRectangle(Child Class)
-> CCircle(Child Class)

There is an interface defined:

-> IRectangle(Interface for the class CRectangle)

Description
***********
	This example is used to explain the Object Oriented Programing concepts ,which are inheritance, abstraction and overriding, interface,
overloading operators, Static concept.
	The program gets user choice about type of shape , whether Rectangle or Circle. After choosing the shape, provide 
the required attributes, it calculates the area of the shape.The code is iterated again to find area of another desired shape 
till the loop is exited by the user.The count of shapes and total area of all shapes area are maintained using static concepts.
This program is just for the purpose of understanding Object Oriented Programing concepts.

Topics Learnt
*************
	Apart from the topics implemented. all these following topics were also learnt on the go.
-> Namespaces
-> Preprocessor Directives
-> Exception Handling
-> File I/O
